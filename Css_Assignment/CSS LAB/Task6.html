                Why a Green Environment Matters :- <br><br>
                 <div class="another">A green environment provides clean air, pure water, fertile soil, and a stable
                    climate. Trees and plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, helping to fight climate change.
                    Forests and natural habitats also support countless species of animals, insects, and microorganisms,
                    keeping ecosystems healthy and resilient. Moreover, spending time in nature reduces stress, improves
                    mental health, and strengthens community
                    connections. A green environment is not just about nature survival, but also about our health,
                    happiness, and quality of life.
